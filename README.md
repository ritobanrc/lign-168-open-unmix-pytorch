Ritoban Roy-Chowdhury, Janice Kim, Jaron Zamora, Claire Zhang, Natalie DiMeo

This project aimed to separate difference voices in audio. It is a fork of OpenUnmix -- for the original OpenUnmix README, see README-OpenUnmix.md. 

Weights are available in the `open-unmix` folder, and code for experiments are in the IPython notebooks in the root of the repository.
